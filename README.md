# EjectAll

Eject all mounted Mac OS X disk images at once.

## Usage

The main use case is to clean up mounted disk images after a session of installing software on Mac OS X.

- When launched, this app will eject all mounted disk images.
- If launched again another time within 20 seconds, it will also eject all mounted physical drives.

The recommended setup is to add this app in the Finder windows toolbar, to replace the native “eject” button. The icon is made to fit properly in there.

## Deprecation notice

This was super useful before the App Store came along. Installing software through disk images is now less common and this script doesn't have much of a use case anymore.
